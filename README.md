Dynamic Thread Pool Management (DTPM) techniques are essential for optimizing the performance and resource utilization of concurrent and parallel computing systems. 

This survey paper categorizes existing DTPM techniques and examines their characteristics, advantages, and limitations. 

It starts with an overview of thread pools' importance and the need for dynamic management techniques to handle varying workloads efficiently. 

The techniques are classified into Load-based, Adaptive, and Predictive categories, each addressing different aspects of dynamic thread pool management. 

Hybrid Approaches that combine multiple techniques are also discussed. The paper provides insights into the principles and practical implications of DTPM techniques, identifying open research challenges and future exploration avenues.

Additionally, the paper introduces a methodology for evaluating resource manager (RM) configurations using model fuzzing to address the complexity of configuring RMs accurately. 

It proposes a Distributed Thread Pool (DTP) system for dynamic optimization and overload management, which effectively detects and resolves overload conditions. 

The paper also discusses related work on dynamic optimization and overload management of Thread Pool Systems (TPS) and presents mathematical models and dynamic adjustment mechanisms for thread pool management.

Finally, the survey delves into three research papers focusing on thread optimization techniques, performance studies, and dynamic optimization designs for thread pool systems. 

Each paper contributes valuable insights to the realm of thread optimization, providing methodologies to enhance the efficiency of parallel execution and resource usage in computing environments.
